# Boston_trees
Shiny app for tree-planting in Boston

This app is designed to support successful tree-planting in Boston. It is hosted at https://zoeywerbin.shinyapps.io/Boston_trees/, but can be generated locally from the files in this repo. Raw data is not stored here on Github, but is available upon request. Raw data is needed to run the files `prepMapData.r` and `prepTreeData.r`. Processed data files are included in the `data` folder and are sufficient for the app to run using the shiny::runApp() command.

The `www` folder includes images and icons for the app, as well as a custom CSS file. 

Analyses included in this application were carried out by the Boston University Spring 2019 Practicum in Terrestrial Biogeoscience. R code for the app was written by Zoey Werbin.
