In this markdown document, we'll run through the creation of our models for the "historical" data from 5 NEON sites. We will model the ratio of bacteria and archaea (as one combined group) to fungi. Our current covariates are daily  precipitation and minimum daily temperature, both averaged to the month level.

We have other covariates that describe each site, such as mean canopy height, and climate descriptors (MAP and MAT). We also have covariates such as pH that we hope to include if we receive more data from NEON.

### read in dataframe with response variable and covariates
df <- readRDS("data/calibration_model_data.rds")
sites <- c("DSNY", "HARV", "OSBS", "CPER", "STER")
