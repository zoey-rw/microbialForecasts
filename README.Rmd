## Overview

This analysis uses state-space hierarchical models to explore spatio-temporal trends in the diversity and relative abundances of soil microbes. Dozens of microbial groups are modeled at the plot level, with hundreds of plots located within dozens of NEON sites across the United States. 

## Main directories:


### data_construction
Scripts for downloading and preparing covariate and microbial data from NEON and other sources.

### analysis
Scripts for fitting and analyzing Bayesian state-space models in the NIMBLE language. Code for phylogenetic analysis of bacterial genera is in "phylogeny/".

### shinyapp/ 
For visualizing forecasts of specific microbial forecasts, parameter estimates, and model convergence diagnostics.

### figures/
Output folder for all figures.

### data/ 
Contains reference data, raw data, model_outputs, and model inputs ("clean/"). Raw data and model outputs are not pushed to GitHub.
